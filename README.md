# ZhihuRec Dataset
ZhihuRec dataset is constructed by the Information Retrieval group of Tsinghua Unversity (THUIR) and Zhihu company, and it is for research purposes only.

ZhihuRec dataset is collected from a knowledge-sharing platform (Zhihu), which is composed of around 100M interactions collected within 10 days, 798K users, 165K questions, 554K answers, 240K authors, 70K topics, and more than 501K user query logs. There are also descriptions of users, answers, questions, authors, and topics, which are anonymous. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest real-world interaction dataset for personalized recommendation.
